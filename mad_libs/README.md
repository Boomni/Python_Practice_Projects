# Mad Libs
---
Mad Libs is a word game where a story or poem is written with blank spaces that the user will fill in with their own words. The completed story or poem is often humorous and can be a fun way to pass the time.

This Mad Libs project allows the user to choose between creating a poem, story, or joke.
The program will then provide a template for the chosen project type and prompt the user to fill in the necessary words.
Once the user has provided all of the required words, the program will insert the user's input into the template and print the completed Mad Libs project.
